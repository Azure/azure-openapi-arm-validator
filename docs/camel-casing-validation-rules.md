#M3016 - DefinitionsPropertiesNamesCamelCase/BodyPropertiesNamesCamelCase
## Description
This violation is flagged if a model definition's property name (DefinitionsPropertiesNamesCamelCase) or a request body parameter's property name (BodyPropertiesNamesCamelCase)  is not in `camelCase` format. This is because the model's properties are sent across the wire and must adhere to common Json conventions for naming. This implies that every property name must start with a lower cased letter and all subsequent words within the name must start with a capital letter. In cases where there are acronyms involved, a maximum of three contiguous capital letters are allowed (acronyms should not be longer that 2 characters - see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/141e06ef(v=vs.71).aspx, third upper case could be start of next word). Eg: `redisCache`, `publicIPAddress`, `location` are valid, but `sampleSQLQuery` is not (must be renamed as `sampleSqlQuery`).

## How to fix
Convert the property name string into `camelCase` format as suggested in the description
