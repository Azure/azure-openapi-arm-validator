# OperationIdSingleUnderscore
## Description
Operation ids are unique identifiers for operations. AutoRest's convention is to split operation ids that have underscores in them and use the first part as the name of an operation group. Multiple underscores in an operation id are not permitted.
## How to fix
Remove any extra underscores.
